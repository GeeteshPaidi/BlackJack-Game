## BlackJack Game
This is an absolute replica of blackjack in terms of real life situations.   
Blackjack is a simple, fun, card game with some specific rules:   

### Objective:
The objective of Blackjack is to beat the dealer's hand without going over 21.   

### Card Values:
Numbered cards (2 through 10) are worth their face value.   
Face cards (Jack, Queen, King) are each worth 10 points.  
Aces can be worth either 1 or 11 points, depending on which value benefits the player's hand the most without exceeding 21.  

### Gameplay:
Initial Deal: Each player (including the dealer) is dealt two cards face up. The dealer receives one card face up and one card face down. 

Player's Turn:
The player can choose to:  
"Hit": Take an additional card.  
"Stand": Keep their current hand.  
"Double Down" (optional): Double their original bet and receive exactly one additional card.  
"Split" (if dealt a pair): Split the pair into two separate hands and play each hand separately. Each hand requires an additional bet equal to the original bet.  
The player may continue to "hit" until they decide to "stand" or until their hand exceeds 21 (bust), in which case they lose.   


Dealer's Turn:  
The dealer reveals their face-down card.  
The dealer must hit until their hand reaches a value of at least 17.  
If the dealer busts (exceeds 21), player wins.  

Determining the Winner:  
If the player's hand is closer to 21 than the dealer's hand without exceeding 21, the player wins.  
If the dealer's hand is closer to 21 than the player's hand without exceeding 21, the dealer wins.  
If both the player and dealer have the same total (push), the player keeps their bet but does not win additional money.  
If the player's hand exceeds 21 (bust), the player loses regardless of the dealer's hand.  
If the dealer busts and the player does not, the player wins.  

### Note: It would be appreciated if someone can implement the double down and split part of the player's turn
